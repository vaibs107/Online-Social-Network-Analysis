ONLINE SOCILA NETWORK ANALYSIS

The course, "Online Social Network Analysis" is all about exploring the latest algorithms for analyzing online social networks, considering both their structure and content. Fundamentals of social graph theory including distance, search, influence, community discovery, diffusion, and graph dynamics, text analysis with an emphasis on the type of text used in online social networks and common applications are covered theoretically and implemented through a set of small projects.  The application of this technology is related to areas such as public health, crisis response, politics, and marketing.  

Objectives:
1. Understand the theoretical foundations of graph analysis, including clustering, search, homophily, and diffusion.
2. Understand the theoretical foundations of text analysis, including classification, clustering, and information extraction in the context of network and text media analysis.
3. Practice design and implementation of a system that applies the principles of graph and text analysis to a problem in online social networks
